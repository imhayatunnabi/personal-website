          Learning HTML and CSS is a lot more challenging than it used to be.
          Responsive web design adds more layers of complexity to design and
          develop websites.

          Having the right set of web developer skills is essential to success
          in this profession. Though the exact skills needed for someone in this
          profession will vary by company, the overall skillset web developers
          need are the same.

          The benefits offered by these communities are 'on another level' as I
          would say. They have helped people start from scratch and eventually
          land jobs in big tech companies like Google and Microsoft. They have
          also developed mentors and have helped improve their code writing and
          reviewing skills.
